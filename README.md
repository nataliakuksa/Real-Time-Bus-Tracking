# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
This project takes data in real time from city bus information. It then tracks buses on a map.

How to run: download files into a folder and open Index.html in your broweser.

In the future I would like to add light and dark themes, based on the time of day at the location.

As it says in the repository label, the license is MIT.
